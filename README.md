## Range Structures

Some data structures that can be used in range-operations or range-calculations.

- `Blocks.py`: Use blocks to answer offline questions. `[l, r]` are stored separately.

- `FenwickTree.py`: Point-add and range-sum.

- `OperationalFenwickTree.py`: Value changed monotonely and prefix result returned.

- `SparseTable.py`: Sparse table, with no updates.

- `SegmentTree.py`: Origninal segment tree with point-updates.

- `LazySegmentTree.py`: Segment tree with lazy propagation.
