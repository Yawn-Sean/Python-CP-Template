## Range Structures

Some data structures that can be used in range-operations or range-calculations.

- `Blocks.py`: Use blocks to answer offline questions. `[l, r]` are stored separately.

- `FenwickTree.py`: Point-add and range-sum.

- `OperationalFenwickTree.py`: Value changed monotonely and prefix result returned.

- `SparseTable.py`: Sparse table, with no updates.

- `SegmentTree.py`: Origninal segment tree with point-updates.

- `LazySegmentTree.py`: Segment tree with lazy propagation.

## Number Theory

Classic number theory method

- `Primes.py`: Check if a number is a prime; prime factorization; give all the factors of a number.

- `(Generalized_)Factorial.py`: Gives the result of `A! mod b` and some relevant values.

- `Power_of_Matrix.py`: Calculate the power of a grid modulo a number.

- `Mobius_Inversion.py`: Mobius inversion.

- `Chinese_Remainder_Theorem.py`: Gives a modulo solution of the given constraints.

- `Floor_Sum.py`: A classic Problem.

- `Polynomial.py`: Classic operations on a polyniomial.
